# Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Chapter Website
In October of 2024, I decided to develop a website for the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a music fraternity I am a member of at JMU. This website provides general information about the fraternity, pictures from latest events, and a directory of current collegiate members of the Gamma Alpha Chapter. In this project, I developed the front-end of the website. Since this is a simple website project, there is no database being used, though I am currently storing brother directory information in a Google Sheet where up to date information is fetched.
