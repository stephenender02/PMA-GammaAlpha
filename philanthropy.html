    <!-- About Bill Posey -->
    <h2 style="color: #e5b300;">About Bill Posey</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Bill Posey graduated from James Madison University in 1979 in Music Performance.
      From there, he served the School of Music from 1981-2012, serving as the Assistant Band Director for the Marching Royal Dukes for 32 Years and Director
      of Concert and Support services for the JMU School of Music for 37 years.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">“Bill and his wife did not have children,
      but he was still an incredible father. He was a father figure to thousands — to every generation of the
      Marching Royal Dukes [and] School of Music,” Scott Rikkers, associate director of bands at JMU and director of the
      Marching Royal Dukes, said. “That kind of sums up how people perceive Bill, as their second dad at JMU, or their ‘band dad.’”
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">He was also involved with the Massanutten Brass Band,
      the Waynesboro Symphony Orchestra, the Just Jazzin’ big band, the Massanutten Brass Quintet, the Valley Wind Ensemble, and other chamber groups.
      Bill was also the director of the 65-piece Harrisonburg/Rockingham Concert Band from 1988 - 2012. His impact on JMU and the Harrisonburg Community is unmeasurable.
    </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 20px;">“He is the epitome of what we want our members to do
      both here at JMU and once they leave to go into their communities,” Rikkers said.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">During his time at JMU, He was also involved in Phi Mu Alpha,
      initiated in 1974, and was later awarded the Orpheus Award, the highest honor a chapter may bestow.
    </p>
    <!-- The Philanthropy -->
    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; color: #e5b300;"">The Philanthropy</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">For his efforts in Phi Mu Alpha, James Madison University,
      and the Harrisonburg Community, the Gamma Alpha Chapter of PMA wishes to honor his legacy with the Bill Posey Philanthropy,
      a scholarship fund created for JMU Summer Band Camps. This scholarship will go towards Local Rockingham County / Harrisonburg
      Students to help support paying for SBC.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">All funding will go straight to the JMU Band Program, who will then send the money via coupon codes when registering for SBC.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Phi Mu Alpha believes in the advancement of music in America,
      and by creating more opportunities for access to music, this is how we will honor his memory.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">However, we can not do this without your help.
      We ask that for you to share this fundraiser with anyone you can, anyone who believes in access to music.
      Even if you can donate one dollar, that is one dollar to provide opportunities to young musicians who did not have that chance before.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Thank you for your time.</p>
